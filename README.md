- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ouzdmrkl
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Game Development
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Unity

Hey, I am OÄŸuz. I am a university student who loves games. When I was a little boy, I used to play games with my dad on Playstation and my curiosity began there. I wondered how they make those awesome games. I started developing small games and algorithms on high school. I am currently working at XLAB Game Company. I am developing games professionally for 1.5 years.
